I demonstrate how I implemented the AAA security model — specifically focusing on Authentication and Authorization — using two sample users: Joe and Jeney.



 Authentication verifies the identity of users (ensuring only Joe or Jeney can log in), and Authorization defines what each user is allowed to access or perform in the 



 Created two users with distinct roles

 Implemented secure login logic

 Applied role-based access control

 Followed the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) principles for structured and secure access management



This video provides a clear, practical example of how AAA standards can be applied in modern applications to enhance security and control user behavior.



 Great for anyone learning backend development or security best practices.
